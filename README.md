## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Active Uber account with trip history
- Company expense claim form (Excel template)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdallah-Assaker/uber-trip-exporter.git
   cd uber-trip-exporter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas openpyxl PyPDF2 redmail PyMuPDF Pillow reportlab
   ```

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Get Your Authentication Token

1. Go to [Uber Riders](https://riders.uber.com) and log in
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to the **Network** tab
4. Refresh the page or navigate to your trips
5. Find a request to `graphql`
6. Copy the entire `Cookie` header value

### 2. Configure Token File

1. Create a `token.txt` file in the project directory
2. Paste your cookie string (no quotes needed)
3. Save the file

**Example `token.txt`:**
```
marketing_vistor_id=abc123; udi-id=def456; isWebLogin=true; sid=xyz789; ...
```

### 3. Configure Address Keywords & Email Settings

The script uses keyword-based matching to classify trips as "To Work" or "From Work" since Uber addresses may vary slightly due to location accuracy.

**On first run**, the script will automatically create a `config.json` file with default template. Alternatively, you can copy from the example:

```bash
copy config.json.example config.json
```

The config file format:

```json
{
  "home_address_keywords": [
    "YOUR_HOME_STREET_NAME",
    "YOUR_HOME_LANDMARK", 
    "YOUR_HOME_AREA"
  ],
  "work_address_keywords": [
    "YOUR_WORK_STREET_NAME",
    "YOUR_WORK_LANDMARK",
    "YOUR_WORK_AREA"
  ],
  "fare_breakdown": {
    "enabled": true,
    "description": "Configure fare breakdown to separate base fares from additional fees",
    "subtractable_fee_types": [
      "UberX Priority",
      "أولوية UberX"
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Only fees in 'subtractable_fee_types' will be separated from base fare",
      "Discounts and promotional offers will remain included in the reimbursable amount",
      "Set 'enabled' to false to disable fare breakdown and use total trip cost"
    ]
  },
  "email_config": {
    "enabled": false,
    "recipient_email": "your-work-email@company.com",
    "sender_email": "your-sender-email@gmail.com",
    "sender_password": "your-app-password",
    "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "smtp_port": 587,
    "subject_template": "Uber Trip Report - {month_year}",
    "body_template": "Please find attached the Uber trip report for {month_year}.\n\nTotal amount: ${total_amount}\nNumber of trips: {trip_count}\n\nBest regards,\nUber Trip Exporter"
  }
}
```

#### Address Keywords Configuration

**Update this file** with actual keywords from your addresses:

```json
{
  "home_address_keywords": [
    "223 متفرع من شارع 90",
    "خلف فندق الدوسيت", 
    "N Teseen, New Cairo 1",
    "التسعين الشمالي"
  ],
  "work_address_keywords": [
    "1 Al Tabeer",
    "El-Zaytoun Sharkeya",
    "Zeitoun, Cairo",
    "الطابير"
  ]
}
```

**Tips for choosing keywords:**
- ✅ Use consistent parts of addresses (street names, landmarks)
- ✅ Include both Arabic and English variations
- ✅ Add area/district names that don't change
- ✅ Include nearby landmarks mentioned in addresses
- ❌ Avoid full addresses that may vary
- ❌ Don't use building numbers that might change (e.g., 223 vs 224)
- 🔍 Test by checking actual addresses in the generated `trips.json` file

**Important:** The script automatically filters trips to only include **home↔work commutes**. Only trips that go from home to work OR from work to home will be included in the final report. Personal trips (e.g., work to non-home locations) are automatically excluded.

#### Fare Breakdown Configuration (New Feature)

The script can now separate additional fees (like UberX Priority) from base trip fares for more accurate reimbursement reporting.

**Configuration in `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "fare_breakdown": {
    "enabled": true,
    "subtractable_fee_types": [
      "UberX Priority",
      "أولوية UberX"
    ]
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- ✅ **Parses receipt HTML** to extract individual fare line items
- ✅ **Identifies subtractable fees** matching your configured types
- ✅ **Adds Excel notes** to affected trips (e.g., "Total $237.00 / Subtracted ($29.43) أولوية UberX")
- ✅ **Tracks total** of all subtracted fees in `trips.json`
- ✅ **Keeps base fare** for company reimbursement
- ❌ **Never subtracts discounts/promotions** - those stay included in reimbursable amount

**Benefits:**
- 💰 Separate personal fees (Priority, Waiting Time) from company-reimbursable base fare
- 📝 Clear documentation in Excel with notes explaining adjustments
- 🔧 Fully configurable - add/remove fee types as needed
- 🌍 Supports Arabic and English fee descriptions

**To disable:** Set `"enabled": false` in the fare_breakdown section.

#### Email Configuration (Optional)

The script can automatically compress monthly reports into ZIP files and email them to you. This feature uses **Red Mail**, a modern Python email library.

**To enable email functionality:**

1. **Set `enabled` to `true`** in the email_config section
2. **Configure your email settings:**

**For Gmail (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "email_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "recipient_email": "your-work@company.com",
    "sender_email": "your-gmail@gmail.com",
    "sender_password": "your-app-password",
    "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "smtp_port": 587
  }
}
```

**Gmail Setup Steps:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password: [Google App Passwords Guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
3. Use the App Password (not your regular password) in the config
4. Update sender_email with your Gmail address
5. Update recipient_email with where you want to receive reports

**For Other Email Providers:**
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com:587`
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com:587`
- **Custom SMTP**: Update smtp_server and smtp_port accordingly

**Email Features:**
- 📦 **Automatic ZIP compression** of monthly folders
- 📧 **HTML and plain text** email formats
- 🎨 **Professional email templates** with trip summary
- 🔒 **Secure STARTTLS encryption**
- 🧹 **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
- Get a fresh cookie from your browser
- Update `token.txt` with the new cookie
- Ensure no extra quotes or spaces in the token file

### Email Issues
- **Authentication Failed**: 
  - For Gmail: Ensure 2FA is enabled and you're using an App Password
  - Check that sender_email and sender_password are correct
  - Verify the App Password doesn't contain spaces
- **Connection Failed**:
  - Check internet connection
  - Verify SMTP server settings (smtp.gmail.com:587 for Gmail)
  - Try again in a few moments
- **Permission Denied**:
  - Check email provider's security settings
  - Ensure "Less secure app access" is not blocking the connection (use App Passwords instead)

### Invalid Month Parameter
- Month must be an integer between 1 and 12
- Use `python uber-script.py 7` not `python uber-script.py July`
- Check command syntax: `python uber-script.py [month]`

### Trip Classification Issues (To Work / From Work)
- Trips showing as blank reason or incorrect classification
- **Solution**: Update address keywords in the script
- Check `trips.json` for actual address strings used by Uber
- Add more keyword variations to `home_address_keywords` and `work_address_keywords`
- Use partial addresses that are consistent (street names, landmarks, areas)

**Example address keyword debugging:**
1. Run the script and check `YYYY-MM/trips.json`
2. Look at `pickup_location` values for your actual trips
3. Find consistent parts and add them to keyword lists
4. Re-run the script to test classification

### Enhanced Debugging with New Logging

The script now provides **detailed colored console output** to help with troubleshooting:

- 🔍 **API Progress**: See real-time API call status and response details
- 📊 **Trip Processing**: Progress indicators show which trips are being processed
- 📁 **File Operations**: Clear feedback on file creation, Excel writing, and PDF merging
- ⚠️ **Warning Messages**: Detailed warnings for missing data or classification issues
- ❌ **Error Details**: Specific error messages with context for easier debugging

**Tips for using the enhanced logging:**
- 🎨 **Colors**: Green = Success, Blue = Info, Yellow = Warning, Red = Error
- ⏱️ **Timestamps**: Each message shows exactly when it occurred
- 📈 **Progress**: Watch the `[X/Y]` indicators to see processing status

### Missing Output Files
- Check the month-specific folder (e.g., `2025-09/`)
- Files are organized in folders, not in the main directory
- Look for the pattern `YYYY-MM/` where YYYY-MM matches your target month
- Console output will show exactly which folder was created

### No Data Found
- Verify you had Uber trips in the specified month/year
- Check if the month logic is correct (December uses previous year)
- Ensure your date range covers the intended period
- Console shows exact date range being queried
- **Fixed in v2.1**: Timezone issues that caused missing trips have been resolved

### Missing Trips (Especially Early in Month)
- **This issue has been FIXED in v2.1** with proper UTC timezone handling
- If using an older version, update to get complete trip data
- The script now uses pagination to fetch all trips, not just the first 60

### Missing Receipts
- Check internet connection
- Verify trips exist in your Uber account
- Some older trips may not have downloadable receipts
- Temporary receipts folder is automatically cleaned up after processing
- **New Receipt Format**: The script automatically handles both old (single-page) and new (two-page) receipt formats
- Two-page receipts are combined side-by-side in landscape orientation in the merged PDF

### Excel Errors
- Ensure the Excel template is in the same directory
- Don't modify the structure of the Excel template
- Original template should remain as `Private_Taxi_Claim_Form.xlsx`
