This is a python script that was created to automate a process that is required from me to do every month. As my company provide me a transportation allowance with Uber, They require me to submit an excel sheet with all the rides I took during the month from and to work. they provided the excel sheet structure and it is located in the same folder with the script.

The script will extract the required information from graphQL apis and fill the excel sheet with the required information.

It will also download the receipts for each trip during the month and merge them into a single pdf file for ease of printing.

## Instructions for code generation
- Always add proper console logs to track progress and errors
